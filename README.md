# Marching-Cubes

Original Repository: https://github.com/SebLague/Marching-Cubes

Based on the original repository I have implemented a Destructor functionality, to give the effect of Terraforming.

The deformation is also accelerated by GPU's compute shader (DensityModifier.compute).

There is also an Asteroid Generator but still requires further optimization to give a better result.


To run this project you'll need to open it in the Unity game engine: https://unity3d.com/
